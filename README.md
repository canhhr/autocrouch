👉 You can use the "AutoCrouch" program in any game, regardless of whether it is a first-person shooter (FPS) or a third-person shooter (TPS). When the program is opened, it prompts you to select the crouch button (C / CTRL). Once selected, the program starts running. You can activate the autocrouch feature by pressing F1 and deactivate it by pressing F2. The program automatically makes your character crouch when you fire in the game. There is no risk or ban associated with using this program.Sample pictures;
